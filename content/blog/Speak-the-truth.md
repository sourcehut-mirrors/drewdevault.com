Today, we're looking at two case studies in how to respond when reactionaries
appear in your free software community.

## Exhibit A

> It is a technical decision.
> 
> The technical reason is that the security team does not have the bandwidth to
> provide lifecycle maintenance for multiple X server implementations. Part of
> the reason for moving X from main to community was to reduce the burden on the
> security team for long-term maintenance of X. Additionally, nobody so far on
> the security team has expressed any interest in collaborating with
> <span class="redacted">xxxxxx</span> on security concerns.
> 
> We have a working relationship with Freedesktop already, while we would have
> to start from the beginning with <span class="redacted">xxxxxx</span>.
> 
> Why does nobody on the security team have any interest in collaboration with
> <span class="redacted">xxxxxx</span>? Well, speaking for myself only here --
> when I looked at their official chat linked in their README, I was immediately
> greeted with alt-right propaganda rather than tactically useful information
> about <span class="redacted">xxxxxx</span> development. At least for me, I
> don't have any interest in filtering through hyperbolic political discussions
> to find out about CVEs and other relevant data for managing the security
> lifecycle of X.
> 
> Without relevant security data products from
> <span class="redacted">xxxxxx</span>, as well as a professionally-behaving
> security contact, it is unlikely for <span class="redacted">xxxxxx</span> to
> gain traction in any serious distribution, because X is literally one of the
> more complex stacks of software for a security team to manage already.
> 
> At the same time, I sympathize with the need to keep X alive and in good
> shape, and agree that there hasn't been much movement from freedesktop in
> maintaining X in the past few years. There are many desktop environments which
> will never get ported to Wayland and we do need a viable solution to keep
> those desktop environments working.

I know the person who wrote this, and I know that she's a smart cookie, and
therefore I know that she probably understood at a glance that the community
behind this "project" literally wants to lynch her. In response, she takes the
high road, avoids confronting the truth directly, and gives the trolls a bunch
of talking points to latch on for counter-arguments. Leaves plenty of room for
them to bog everyone down in concern trolling and provides ample material to
fuel their attention-driven hate machine.

There's room for improvement here.

## Exhibit B

![Screenshot of a post by Chimera Linux which reads "any effort to put (redacted) in chimera will be rejected on the technical basis of the maintainers being reactionary dipshits"](https://redacted.moe/f/d9dd3368.png)

Concise, speaks the truth, answers ridiculous proposals with ridicule, does not
afford the aforementioned reactionary dipshits an opportunity to propose a
counter-argument. A+.

Extra credit for the follow-up:

The requirement for a passing grade in this class is a polite but summary
dismissal, but additional credit is awarded for anyone who does not indulge
far-right agitators as if they were equal partners in maintaining a sense of
professional decorum.

If you are a community leader in FOSS, you are not obligated to waste your time
coming up with a long-winded technical answer to keep nazis out of your
community. They want you to argue with them and give them attention and feed
them material for their reactionary blog or whatever. Don't fall into their
trap. Do not answer bad faith with good faith. This is a skill you need to learn
in order to be an effective community leader.

If you see nazis üëèüëè you ban nazis üëèüëè --- it's as simple as that.

*The name of the project is censored not because it's particularly hard for you
to find, but because all they really want is attention, and you and me are going
to do each other a solid by not giving them any of that directly.*

*To preclude the sorts of reply guys who are going to insist on name-dropping
the project and having a thread about the underlying drama in the comments, the
short introduction is as follows:*

*For a few years now, a handful of reactionary trolls have been stoking division
in the community by driving a wedge between X11 and Wayland users, pushing a
conspiracy theory that paints RedHat as the DEI boogeyman of FOSS and assigning
reactionary values to X11 and woke (pejorative) values to Wayland. Recently,
reactionary opportunists "forked" Xorg, replaced all of the literature with
political manifestos and
<abbr title="Coded language that signals in-group status between reactionaries and hate groups while appearing benign to outsiders who don't recognize their dialect. 'DEI' is an example of a dog-whistle: it appears overtly benign, but reactionaries use it when they want to say the N-word in polite company.">dog-whistles</abbr>,
then used it as a platform to start shit
with downstream Linux distros by petitioning for inclusion and sending
<abbr title="People who argue in bad faith to disrupt discussions by tactically dwelling on tone, rhetoric, philosophy, or procedural issues. Often they have no prior affiliation with the community and show up just to cause trouble, taking advantage of the better nature of hapless moderators and bystanders to further the aim of helping trolls fly under the radar and shifting the Overton window of a community to the right.">concern trolls</abbr>
to waste everyone's time.*

*The project itself is of little consequence; they serve our purposes today by
providing us with case-studies in dealing with reactionary idiots starting shit
in your community.*
