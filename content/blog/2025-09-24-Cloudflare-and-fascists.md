title: Cloudflare bankrolls fascists

US politics has been pretty fascist lately. The state is filling up
concentration camps, engaging in mass state violence against people on the basis
of racialized traits, deporting them to random countries without any respect for
habeas corpus, exerting state pressure on the free press to censor speech
critical of the current administration, and Trump is openly floating the idea of
an unconstitutional third term.

Fascism is clearly on the rise, and they're winning more and more power.
None of this is far removed from us in the FOSS community -- there are a number
of fascists working in FOSS, same as the rest of society. I don't call them
fascists baselessly -- someone who speaks out in support of and expresses
solidarity with fascists, or who uses fascists dog-whistles or promotes fascist
ideology and talking points, or boosts fascist conspiracy theories -- well,
they're a fascist.

If one consistently speaks in support of a certain political position and
against the opponents of that position then it is correct to identify them with
this political position. Facts, as it were, don't care about feelings, namely
the feelings that get hurt when someone is called a fascist. Fascists naturally
do not want to be identified as such and will reject the label, but we shouldn't
take their word for it. People should be much more afraid of being called out as
fascist than they are afraid of calling someone a fascist. If someone doesn't
want to be called a fascist, they shouldn't act like one.

It's in this disturbing political context that I saw an odd post from the
Cloudflare blog pop up in my circles this week: [Supporting the future of the
open web: Cloudflare is sponsoring Ladybird and Omarchy][0]. Based on
[Ladybird's sponsorship terms][ladybird-sponsor] we can assume that these
projects received on the order of $100,000 USD from Cloudflare. I find this odd
for a few reasons, in particular because one thing that I know these two
projects have in common is that they are both run by fascists.

[ladybird-sponsor]: https://ladybird.org/#faq

Even at face value this is an unusual pair of projects to fund. I'm all for FOSS
projects getting funded, of course, and I won't complain about a project's
funding on the solitary basis that it's an odd choice. I will point out that
these are odd choices, though, especially Omarchy.

Ladybird makes some sense, given that it's aligned in principle with
Cloudflare's stated objective to "support the open web", though I remain bearish
that new web browser engines are even [possible to make][1].[^1] Omarchy is a
bizarre choice, though -- do we really need another pre-customized Arch Linux
distribution? And if we do, do we really need a big corporation like Cloudflare
to bankroll it? Everyone on /r/unixporn manages to make Arch Linux look pretty
for free.

[^1]: I did think it was cute that Kling used a screenshot of Ladybird rendering
    my blog post [back in 2023](https://awesomekling.substack.com/p/how-were-building-a-browser-when)
    to headline one of his articles on Ladybird, though.

Omarchy is a *very* weird project to fund, come to think of it. Making an Arch
Linux spin technically requires *some* work, and work is work, I won't deny it,
but most of the work done here is from Arch Linux and Hyprland. Why not fund
those, instead? Well, don't fund Hyprland, since it's also [run by][2] a [bunch
of fascists][3], but you get my point.

Anyway, Omarchy and Ladybird are both run by fascists. Omarchy makes this pretty
obvious from the outset -- on [the home page][4] the big YouTube poster image
[prominently features](https://redacted.moe/f/ba0d7a6b.png) SuperGrok, which is
a pathetically transparent dog-whistle to signal alliance with Elon Musk's
fascist politics. Omarchy is the pet project of David Heinemeier Hansson, aka
DHH, who is well known as a rich [fascist][dhh fascist 1] [weirdo][dhh fascist
2].[^2] One need only consult [his blog][6] to browse his [weird, racist views
on immigration][7], [fat-shaming objections to diverse representation][8],
[vaguely anti-feminist/homophobic/rapey rants on consent][9], and, recently,
[tone-policing antifascists][10] who celebrate the death of notable fascist
Charlie Kirk.

[^2]: And a multi-millionaire who can fund his "Arch Linux for Obnoxious
    Reactionary Assholes" project his own damn self, in my opinion. He also
    [does not want][5] to be called a fascist, in which case he should probably
    stop being so fucking faschy.

Speaking of tributes to Charlie Kirk, that brings us to Andreas Kling, the
project lead for Ladybird, who tweeted on the occasion of his assassination:

> RIP Charlie Kirk
>
> I hope many more debate nerds carry on his quest to engage young people with
> words, not fists.

Kling has had a few things to say about Kirk on Twitter lately. [Here's another
one](https://nitter.net/awesomekling/status/1967178708852097278) -- give you
three guesses as to which "[group]" he objects to punching. You may also recall
that Kling achieved some notoriety for his obnoxious response as the maintainer
of SerenityOS when someone proposed gender-neutral language for the
documentation:

[![Screenshot of the interaction on GitHub. Kling responds "This project is not an appropriate arena to advertise your personal politics."](https://redacted.moe/f/d57df43b.png)](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/6814)

Replacing "he" with "they" in one sentence of the documentation is the kind of
"ideologically motivated change" that Serenity's [CONTRIBUTING.md] apparently
aims to prevent, a classic case of the sexist "identities that are not men are
inherently political" nonsense. Ladybird has a [similar, weirdly defensive
policy][ladybird CONTRIBUTING.md] on "neutrality", and a milquetoast [code of
conduct][ladybird coc], which is based on the Ruby Community Conduct Guideline,
which has been itself the subject of many controversies due to its inadequacy
leading to real-world incidents of harassment and abuse.

[CONTRIBUTING.md]: https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#on-ideologically-motivated-changes

[ladybird coc]: https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Here's another one -- Kling endorsing white replacement theory in June:

> > White males are actively discriminated against in tech. 
> >
> > Itâ€™s an open secret of Silicon Valley. 
>
> One of the last meetings I attended before leaving Apple (in 2017) was
> management asking us to "keep the corporate diversity targets in mind" when
> interviewing potential new hires.
>
> The phrasing was careful, but the implication was pretty clear.
>
> I knew in my heart this wasn't wholesome, but I was too scared to rock the
> boat at the time.

[^danheld]: Who is ultimately responding to @shaunmmaguire's tweet [lying about
    being told he wouldn't be promoted at Google for being white](https://nitter.net/shaunmmaguire/status/1872479474157252767#m).
    Shaun also posts about [the threat](https://nitter.net/shaunmmaguire/status/1970195581797826769) of
    "Radical Islamist" "Marxists" to whom Europe "will be lost",
    [falsely](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/doj-deletes-own-study-website-032537612.html)
    [accuse](https://nitter.net/shaunmmaguire/status/1969615941282775120) the
    "far left" of committing "almost all mass murders and political violence" in
    the last few years, and [praise](https://nitter.net/shaunmmaguire/status/1968476676603732293)
    Trump for classifying antifascists as terrorists.

And in a moment of poetic irony, a few days ago Kling [spoke in
solidarity][dhh-kling] with DHH over his "persecution" for "banal, mainstream
positions" on Twitter just a few days ago, in response to DHH's tweet
signal-boosting another [notable reactionary tech fascist][lunduke], Bryan
Lunduke.

[dhh-kling]: https://nitter.net/awesomekling/status/1969350008538370216

So, to sum it up, Kling wears his mask a bit better than DHH, but as far as I'm
concerned it seems clear that both projects are run by fascists. If it walks
like a fascist and quacks like a fascist... then why is Cloudflare giving them
hundreds of thousands of dollars?
